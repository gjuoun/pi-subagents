/**
 * no-fs-on-render.perf.test.ts — a frame must not touch the disk.
 *
 * The widget and the conversation viewer redraw on every TUI frame, so a
 * synchronous read on either path blocks the event loop at up to 62 Hz. Nothing
 * on those paths reads today; this is the guard that keeps it that way, because
 * the mistake is easy to make and impossible to see in a functional test — the
 * output is identical either way, only the terminal stutters.
 *
 * `node:fs` is mocked wholesale rather than spied on: `src/` imports its
 * functions by name (`import { readFileSync } from "node:fs"`), and a named ESM
 * binding cannot be replaced after the importing module has been evaluated.
 *
 * Lives in its own file because that mock applies to the whole module graph;
 * the other guards must not inherit it.
