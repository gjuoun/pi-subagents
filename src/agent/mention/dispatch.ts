/**
 * dispatch.ts — the @handle dispatcher: pi's input hook, and what a mention does.
 *
 * Moved out of the entrypoint as-is. A handle names the *agent*, not one process, so one syntax
 * covers its whole lifecycle: message it while it runs, resume it once it has finished, start it
 * if it never ran. Everything that is not an agent mention falls through untouched, which is what
 * keeps a file path, a bare handle and ordinary prose working.
 *
 * Constructing it installs the hook, the way a route factory registers its routes, so the
 * surface this file owns is stated once.
