/**
 * journal.ts — the record a workflow run leaves so a later run can skip work.
 *
 * Each entry is keyed by position *and* a hash of everything that decides what
 * that agent does; a replay walks positions in order and stops reusing at the
 * first mismatch, because a later match was produced under different upstream
 * conditions. A failure is journaled as one and never replayed as one — resuming
 * a run that died at agent 5 exists to retry agent 5. A journal carrying
 * `agent({ resume })` declines the cache whole: a replayed agent is text from a
 * file, not a live child, so there is nothing for a later `resume` to continue.
 * Under `pipeline` the arrival order can differ, which is why the key is checked
 * as well as the position — that costs cache hits, never correctness.
 *
 * JSON Lines, appended as each agent settles, so a run killed mid-flight keeps
 * everything it had finished.
